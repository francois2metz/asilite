# ASIText

This is designed as a fast and simple access to https://beta.arretsurimages.net/ for mobile devices.

Minimal javacscript will be used.

It use the public API to connect (thanks for that) and will forward any credential to the API. Nothing is stored on the server.

## Status

It's currently just a proof of concept. More features are coming soon.

## Usage

    ./script/server

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to the team at arretsurimages to have an API. I don't like the choice of using javascript on the client side, but the API is very simple to use.
