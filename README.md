# ASIText

This is designed as a fast and simple alternative to https://beta.arretsurimages.net/ for mobile devices.

Minimal javascript is used.

It use the public API to fetch the content. **Nothing is stored on the server**.

## Status

It's currently a proof of concept.

What's working:

- Login
- Listing and pagination of the content
- Showing content
- Displaying video

Planned features:

- RSS feed
- Better navigation
- Option to display the cover images

## Usage

    ./script/server

## Acknowledgement

Thanks to the team at arretsurimages for the API. I disagree with the choice of using javascript on the client side, but the API is very simple to use.
